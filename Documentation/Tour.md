# Tour of GooeyLife

The screen looks like (on a mac)
![Mac Screen](images/Mac_Screen.png)
or (on linux)
![Linux Scrren](images/Linux_Screen.png)

Things to notice.  The menus at the top

![Menus](images/Mac_Menus.png)

and the control bar near the top of the window

![Control Bar](images/Control_Bar.png)

The important menus are **File** and **Examples**.

The control bar has a number of buttons and widgets
* On the left you can run the simulation or move the simulation forward (or backward) a single generation.
* Next are a group of controls to allow you to zoom in on a large population of cells, but we'll leave those alone for now.
* A drop down list that allows you to select the shape of cells (purely cosmetic)
* A checkbox to enable *Edit Mode*
* And a slider to allow you to control the speed of the simulation while running.

Nothing will do much interesting at this point, because there are no living cells.  Let's change that.
Click the checkbox for *Edit Mode* and click somewhere on the screen to make a living cell.  You can 
play with this, but try making this pattern:

![Simple Pattern](images/Simple_Pattern.png)

and then press the single step button ![Single Step](images/Single_Step.png).  and it will evolve into

![Simple First Generation](images/Simple_First_Gen.png)

Now feel free to press the Run button ![Run](images/Run_Button.png) and watch it evolve.  If you haven't
disabled Auto-Zoom, it should automatically zoom out to keep the whole pattern in the window. after about
190 generations you can stop it by pressing the Run button again (though now it will be labeled **Pause**).
It'll reach a stable (though not static) pattern:
