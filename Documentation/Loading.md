# Web resources

There are a number of places where you can find interesting patterns
on the web.  Interest by internet denizens about the _Game of Life_
actually predates the web by a considerable amount.

(A discussion of the differnce between the "web" and the "internet"
is beyond the scope of this document, but the web wasn't invented
until 1993(ish), and the internet was already about two decades old
at that point.)

The best web resources I know of (feel free to email me with more):

* [Life Wiki](https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Main_Page)
    This is a huge respository for everything _Game of Life_. It
    tends to be a bit academic (and exhaustive), but you can find
    lots of intesting categories like
    [Spaceships](https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Category:Spaceships)
    and [Guns](https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Category:Guns) to explore.
* [Dean Hickerson's Page](https://conwaylife.com/ref/DRH/life.html)
    This is the collection of Dean Hickerson, who created the 
    original _Primer_ prime number sieve.  He has a number of links
    (mostly his own work) of various patterns that do interesting
    things.

There are also other simulators out there.  The emulator that is the
gold standard is [Golly](https://golly.sourceforge.io/), which is
quite frankly, far better than this one. It even has a 
[web version](https://golly.sourceforge.io/webapp/golly.html) that 
is faster than this compiled verison.

GooeyLife was really just an excuse for me to learn Go.  I'll continue
to work on it, but I doubt it will every be as complete or as 
performant as _Golly_, but it's still fun to play with.
