# Reporting Bugs

The easiest way to report a bug is by opening a
[Github issue](https://github.com/pneumaticdeath/GooeyLife/issues/new).

You can also find me on the [Gophers Slack server](https://gophers.slack.com/messages/general/) 
([invitation link](https://forum.golangbridge.org/t/how-to-join-gopher-slack-channel/24915))

You're also free to [email me](mailto:mitch@mitchpatenaude.net?Subject=GooeyLife).
