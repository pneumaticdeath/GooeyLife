# GooeyLife 

Welcome to GooeyLife, an implementation of [Conways Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) 
written in the [Go](https://go.dev/) using the [Fyne](https://fyne.io/) windowing toolkit.  

Think of this as a fidget toy for the mind.  The [Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Rules) are 
pretty simple, but the resulting behaviors can be quite complex. In fact, it's impossible to know how all patterns will
turn out, thanks to a famous principal of computer science called the
["halting problem"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem).
